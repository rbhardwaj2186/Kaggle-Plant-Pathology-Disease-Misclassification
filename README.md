# Kaggle-Plant-Pathology-Disease-Misclassification
 Using Fastai vision, transfering weights from resnet 26d model using transfer learning. Predicting image multiclassification of plant into different diseased category or a healthy leaf

 # Problem Statement
 Misidentifying agricultural crop diseases may result in chemical misuse, fostering resistant pathogen strains, elevated input expenses, and heightened outbreaks, causing substantial economic and environmental repercussions. Presently, disease diagnosis through human scouting is costly and time-intensive. While computer-vision models hold potential for enhancing efficiency, the wide-ranging symptom variations stemming from factors like tissue age, genetic diversity, and varying light conditions in trees diminish their detection accuracy.

 # Problem Objective
 The aims of the 'Plant Pathology Challenge' involve training a model with the training dataset images to: 1) Precisely categorize test dataset images into distinct disease groups or healthy leaves; 2) Effectively differentiate multiple diseases, potentially present on a single leaf; 3) Handle infrequent classes and new symptoms; 4) Tackle challenges like angle, light, shade, and leaf maturity for accurate depth perception; and 5) Integrate expert insights to guide computer vision in identifying, annotating, quantifying, and learning relevant features.
